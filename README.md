## Introduction 
Find publicly available data for key factors that influence US home prices nationally. Then, build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years. Use the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA.

2. Key Highlights from the model -

Mortgage Rate: 19.987
This coefficient is the largest positive, indicating that an increase in mortgage rates strongly correlates with an increase in the housing index price. This may seem counterintuitive since higher mortgage rates typically reduce housing affordability.

Personal Saving Rate: -2.787
A negative coefficient indicates that an increase in the personal saving rate is associated with a decrease in housing index prices. This makes sense as higher savings rates could mean less spending on housing.

Unemployment Rate: 0.963
A positive coefficient suggests that higher unemployment rates are associated with higher housing index prices.

Also, similar for Income too, it is positive but small suggesting that higher incomes contribute to higher house index.
